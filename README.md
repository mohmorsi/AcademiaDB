## Introduction
AcademiaDB is a student database management solution that streamlines university administration using PostgreSQL. The system centralizes student information such as personal details, academic records, attendance, fees, and scholarships. The goal is to provide a user-friendly, scalable, and secure platform to minimize administrative workload, reduce human error, and improve data accuracy. AcademiaDB is designed to support universities of all sizes in delivering the best education possible.

## Objective
The objective of AcademiaDB is to provide universities with a comprehensive, automated student database management system that can simplify and streamline the administration process. The system aims to:

1. Reduce manual data entry and minimize human error by automating the storage and retrieval of student information.
2. Centralize student information in a secure and scalable platform, making it accessible and easily retrievable to authorized personnel.
3. Enhance data accuracy by automating the data validation process and reducing the risk of data inconsistencies.
4. Improve transparency and accountability by providing real-time information on student attendance, fees, scholarships, and other academic records.
5. Minimize administrative workload and free up valuable time for administrators, enabling them to focus on other critical tasks.

With AcademiaDB, universities can expect a flexible and efficient student database management system that can help them achieve their administrative and academic goals while providing the best possible education to their students.


## Usage

AcademiaDB is used to create a student database in PostgreSQL. 
It creates tables for students, attendance, marks, fees, and scholarships.
1. The students table contains information about each student, including their name, contact information, admission year, and course of study. 
2. The attendance table tracks attendance for each student, with the date and attendance status. 
3. The marks table contains information about each student's marks or grades in different subjects. 
4. The fees table contains information about fees paid by each student. 
5. The scholarships table contains information about scholarships received by each student, including the scholarship name, amount, and start and end dates. 

The script first inserts 10 sample entries into the students table, and some sample entries into the attendance table.
